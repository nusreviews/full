In the absence of such freedom, talented employees may leave out of frustration to search for an institution that can provide the meaning and the environment to achieve their self-actualization. Corporate entrepreneurship is one method of stimulating and capitalizing on employees’ need to think of new ideas and do things better for their organisation. On a business level, an organization needs self-renewal, which involves transformation through redefinition of its business concepts, reorganization of its business relationships and reengineering of its business processes. Creating a new venture from scratch is challenging, but developing it within an existing organization is a totally different ball game.

Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?"},{"modId":"FMS1204M","name":"FS: Appreciation of Basic Results in Mathematics","description":"Mathematical results are crystallizations of the collective wisdom of mankind and have their historical backgrounds, significances, impacts and applications.

Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale.

It is well recognized by the world’s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired. In addition, alternative energy resources and technologies also play vital roles in the reduction of CO2 emission."},{"modId":"FMS1210P","name":"Imaging our world","description":"In our daily life we are surrounded by images.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. To our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the “matrix of life”. Nevertheless, various scientific debates are associated with water. For example, unbelievably, in the 1980s French scientist Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the “memory of water”. On the other hand, proteins are the most important functional players for all forms of life. An increasing spectrum of human diseases more than neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by aggregation of specific proteins, while aggregation of non-specific proteins are associated with aging even down to Escherichia coli. In 2005, we discovered that these “aggregated/insoluble” proteins could marvellously be solubilized in pure water, which thus offers my group to tackle an emerging but challenging problem in biology: molecular mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases and aging. In this module, we will explore how water shaped the emergence and evolution of life and how proteins get aggregated and subsequently gain toxicity to trigger diseases and aging. Most importantly, the students will have a full freedom to give their own opinions on these topics/debates."},{"modId":"FMS1214P","name":"Silk: Fibers that make a difference in our world","description":"After long evolution, many biomaterials are of ultra-performance than the artificial ones.

The scientific process of enquiry is therefore governed by basic and general yet essential principles. Abide by these principles, we will likely do good science (even though the findings may not be what we have expected, if not wanted, it to be). Ignore these principles we will be on a slippery slope to bad science. Violate these principles we will end up with ugly science. Students will learn about essential principles of scientific enquiry and why they are important in the acquisition of knowledge, and when they are ignored or violated, it will lead to bad and ugly consequences as had occurred in the real world.

Fact construction plays a particularly prominent role in litigation, but it also appears in methods of alternative dispute resolution and justifications of policy positions. This module will analyze the pervasive reach of fact construction in the law, examine why fact construction is such an effective tool of legal persuasion, and explore advanced techniques of fact construction."},{"modId":"LL4214","name":"International and Comparative Oil and Gas Law","description":"The module explores principles and rules relating to the exploration for, development and production of oil and gas (upstream operations). The main focus of the module is on the examination of different arrangements governing the legal relationship between states and international oil companies, such as modern concessions, productionsharing agreements, joint ventures, service and hybrid contracts. The agreements governing the relationships between companies involved in upstream petroleum operations (joint operating and unitisation agreements) will also be examined. The module will further explore the issues of dispute settlement, expropriation, stability of contracts and a relevant international institutional and legal framework."},{"modId":"LL4219","name":"The Trial of Jesus in Western Legal Thought","description":"The Trial of Jesusis an excellent case for students to learn how to conduct non-practical studies of legal and normative issues. It is, arguably, the most consequential legal event in the evolution of Western Civilization. We will examine the historical, political, and legal background to the Trial, and, especially, the procedural propriety of the Trial. Questions to be explored include: Were hisprocedural rights preserved during his trial before the Sanhedrin? Was histrial a miscarriage of justice? Through reflecting upon these and other questions, we will explore if and how thistrialshaped the Western culture. This module is also concerned with the ‘method’ or ‘process’ of how students digest and integrate ’substance’ or‘content’. Thus,there is emphasis on the significance of understanding and clarifying, the complexity of each and every problem, and not only the importance of offering, or trying to offer, a clever solution to it."},{"modId":"LL4221","name":"Climate Change Law & Policy","description":"This course will explore legal and policy developments pertaining to climate change. Approaches considered will range in jurisdictional scale, temporal scope, policy orientation, regulatory target, and regulatory objective.

Think of a shipment of steel coils, traveling per train from Germany to the Netherlands, then by sea to Singapore where the last stretch to the end receiver is performed by truck. The course deals with all the legal aspects of such a multimodal contract of carriage."},{"modId":"LL4233V","name":"European Company Law","description":"European company law can be understood in two ways. It can indicate the EU’s approach to company law and thereby lead to an analysis of the harmonized standards for 28 European nations. It can also be understood as a comparative approach to the different legal systems on the European continent. This course includes both aspects. It will first concentrate on EU legislation and jurisdiction, followed by a comparison of the legal systems of the two most important continental European jursidictions, France and Germany. It will lead to an understanding of shared principles of civil law jurisdictions and emphasize important differences to common law systems."},{"modId":"LL4235V","name":"Government Contracts: Int'l & Comparative Perspectives","description":"Today, many governments, like individuals and business entities, enter into contracts. The growing phenomenon of government contracts, especially contracts concluded with foreign nationals, refutes the traditional belief that contract is the domain of private law. This course offers an in-depth examination on how the presence of a government as a proper party to a contract moves the entire analysis on contract formation, performance, breach and dispute settlement to the domains of public law and general international law. It also offers critical perspectives on the mooted confluence of comparative public law and international law to obtain bespoke rules and principles for the regulation of government contracts."},{"modId":"LL4237V","name":"Law, Institutions, and Business in Greater China","description":"This module aims to explore the interaction between legal institutions and economic/business development in Greater China (i.e. China, Taiwan, HK), with focus on China. How has China been able to offset institutional weaknesses at home while achieving impressive economic results worldwide? Have China’s experiences indicated an unorthodox model as captured in the term “Beijing Consensus”? To what extent is this model different from East Asian models and conventional thinking in economic growth? This course reviews theories about market development in the context of Greater China, including securities, corporate regulations, capital markets, property, sovereign wealth funds, foreign investment, and anticorruption etc."},{"modId":"LL4242V","name":"Financial Regulation and Central Banking","description":"The course will include various aspects of financial regulation. The focus will be on the regulation of credit institutions and the role of central banks. Other forms of regulation of financial intermediaries and financial markets will be discussed in less detail. Since the focus will be on credit institutions, it will be important that the students understand what distinguishes credit institutions from other providers of financial services and how the regulatory approaches differ. The part on the regulation of credit institutions will include requirements for their authorization, their permanent supervision and rescue scenarios in situations of insolvency and default. These aspects will be discussed from a comparative perspective with the Basel requirements at the core of the discussion, complemented by the implementing norms in important jurisdictions, above all in Singapore. For resolution and restructuring the European Union has taken on a leading role, and, as a consequence, these EU approaches will be analysed in detail. The roles of central banks will remain a core part of the course. Their tasks and objectives will be discussed from a comparative perspective. Their essential role in crisis management, their co-operation with supervisory agencies and their monetary policy will remain essential components of the course."},{"modId":"LL4244V","name":"Criminal Practice","description":"The administration of criminal justice in Singapore relies on an ethical, professional and skilled disposition and management of criminal cases. A good criminal practitioner needs a sound grounding in criminal law and criminal procedure, and a strong base of written and oral advocacy and communication skills.

This module examines the global, regional and bilateral frameworks governing trade, investment, competition and migration across this region. It has three components. The first looks at how different organisations and regimes – the WTO, ASEAN, ASEAN Plus Agreements, BITS, NAFTA and Closer Economic Relations – interact to govern the region and the attempts to reform this, most notably through the TransPacific Partnership Process. The second looks at the detailed laws and processes governing trade in goods and services and investment. The final section looks at a number of further key policies: intellectual property, competition, the professions, and migration."},{"modId":"LL4283V","name":"Artificial Intelligence, Information Science & Law","description":"Advancements in computer science have made it possible to deploy information technology to address legal problems. Improved legal searches, fraud detection, electronic discovery, digital rights management, and automated takedowns are only the beginning. We are beginning to see natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies deployed in contract formation, electronic surveillance, autonomous machines and even decision making. This course examines the basis behind these technologies, deploys them in basic scenarios, studies the reasons for their acceptance or rejection, and analyses them for their benefits, limitations and dangers."},{"modId":"LL4285V","name":"International Dispute Settlement","description":"This seminar will explore key legal questions related to international dispute settlement with a view to providing a broad overview of the field with respect to State-to-State, Investor-State, and commercial disputes. This course will include a discussion of the various types of international disputes and settlement mechanisms available for their resolution.

The course will compare these different legal processes on issues such as jurisdiction, provisional remedies/measures, equal treatment, evidence, and enforcement."},{"modId":"LL4286V","name":"Transnational Terrorism and International Law","description":"While terrorism is not a new phenomenon, the sheer scale and transnational nature of that practice in recent years have challenged some of the core tenets of international law. This seminar investigates the role that international law can play, along with its shortcomings, in suppressing and preventing terrorism. It examines the manner in which terrorism and counterterrorism laws and policies have affected the scope and application of diverse international legal regimes including UN collective security, inter-State use of force, the law of international responsibility, international human rights, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law."},{"modId":"LL4287V","name":"ASEAN Law and Policy","description":"This course examines ASEAN’s ongoing metamorphosis into a rules-based, tri-pillared (political-security, economic, and socio-cultural) Community pursuant to the mandate of the 2007 ASEAN Charter. It deals primarily with Law but is also attentive to the Non Law and Quasi Law aspects inherent in ASEAN’s character as an international actor and regional organisation; its purposes and principles; and its operational modalities, processes, and institutions. Students will grasp the complexities of ASEAN’s conversion to the rule of law and rule of institutions within the context of international law and its frameworks; national competences and jurisdiction; and regional relations and realpolitik."},{"modId":"LL4289V","name":"The Evolution of International Arbitration","description":"The module has three distinctive features. First, it compares international commercial arbitration (ICA) international investment arbitration (ISA). Second, it focuses on the evolution of arbitration, in particular, on the development of the procedures and substantive law that have gradually enabled arbitration to become a meaningfully autonomous legal system. Third, it surveys a variety of explanations for why the arbitral order has evolved as it has – into a more “judicial-like” legal order – focusing on the role of arbitral centres, state regulatory competition, and the reasoning of tribunals in their awards."},{"modId":"LL4290V","name":"Legal Research: Method & Design","description":"The seminar is designed to prepare students to undertake original, primary research in law. Major topics and questions to be covered include: - how to write a good literature review and prospectus; - why one must have a method, or, how are “methods” and “data collection” related?; - what is research design?; - how to avoid, or manage, the problem of “selection bias.” A major component of the seminar, students will assess a variety of published papers, as well as research projects presented by the faculty."},{"modId":"LL4292V","name":"State Responsibility: Theory and Practice","description":"The law governing the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts is absolutely central in public international law and cuts across various sub-fields of that discipline. This seminar investigates the fundamental tenets of the law of State responsibility, both from theoretical and practical standpoints, while tracing some of its historical roots. More broadly, the seminar will provide an overview of different doctrines of State responsibility and different theories and approaches to liability under international law. More importantly, the later sessions of the seminar will engage critically with the role that the law of State responsibility can play in specific areas."},{"modId":"LL4295","name":"Conflict of Laws in Int’l Commercial Arbitration","description":"This course will focus in detail on the instances in which resort to conflict of laws is necessary in the international arbitration context. The objective of this course is to allow participants to realise on how many occasions both State courts and arbitrators will need to report a conflict of laws analysis despite the claim that conflict of laws issues are not relevant in the international commercial arbitration context. Participants will first be taught to identify what conflict of laws rules may apply and will then be given hypothetical cases and will be asked to critically examine whether a solution can be found that does not require a conflict of laws approach."},{"modId":"LL4299","name":"Advanced Issues in the Law & Practice of Int’l Arbitration","description":"This intensive course is designed for students and practitioners already acquainted with the fundamentals of international arbitration, and may be particularly useful for those who may have an inclination to specialize in the practice or study of international dispute resolution. Focus will be placed on topics of practical and academic interest in all aspects of the international arbitration process, looking in particular to recent trends and evolutions in the field of international dispute settlement.\nThrough seminar discussions, student presentations and moot court sessions, this course will expose students to contemporary controversies in the field of international commercial and investment arbitration. An international approach will be adopted in relation to the subjects considered: students can expect to review a substantial amount of comparative law sources, including academic commentaries and jurisprudence from France, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as public international law sources and international arbitral practice."},{"modId":"LL4308V","name":"Behavioural Economics, Law & Regulation","description":"Law is a behavioural system. Most law seeks to regulate, incentivize and nudge people to behave in some ways and not in others – it seeks to shape human behavior. Traditional economic analysis of law is committed to the assumption that people are fully rational, but empirical evidence suggests that people very often exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This course about behavioural law and economics, with an emphasis on regulation, looks at the implications of actual, not hypothesized, human behaviour for the law. It considers, in particular, how using the mildest forms of interventions, law can steer people’s choices in welfarepromoting directions."},{"modId":"LL4309","name":"The Practical Realities of Dispute Resolution in Asia","description":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes. However, resolving disputes through either of these methods makes absolutely no sense if they do not yield a result that is effectively enforceable. The Asean Region, China and India have different cultures to dispute resolution. The New York Convention for enforcing international arbitral awards has been ratified by more than 150 countries but not been harmoniously interpreted by State Courts. The region is also famously known for Guerrilla tactics to scuttle effective dispute resolution. This course aims to set out the practical realities of enforcing court judgments, arbitral awards and mediation settlements."},{"modId":"LL4310V","name":"International Organisations in International Law","description":"This seminar-style module critically examines the impact of international organisations on the formal structures of international law. Do international organisations create and enforce international law? What type of norm-creating activity takes place inside and across international organisations? Does the reality of global governance give rise to concerns about legitimacy or accountability? What are the legal and policy responses to such concerns? Case studies used will range from traditional institutions such as the UN and its specialised agencies, to newer institutions such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."},{"modId":"LL4313V","name":"Mediation/Conciliation of Inter- & Investor-State Disputes","description":"Recent years have witnessed more state-to-state and investor-state disputes, with a substantial increase in resources spent on binding arbitration. Mediation and conciliation are rarely attempted and more rarely successful. This course introduces the student to methods of mediation and conciliation on the international law plane, and surveys existing institutional regimes (ie, ICSID, PCA, SIAC). The focus will then turn to identification and critical analysis of the special legal and policy obstacles to voluntary dispute settlement by states (including SOEs), as well as countervailing incentives. The scope is international, with some readings devoted to Asia. Students will study and critique precedents, and conduct basic mediation/conciliation exercises."},{"modId":"LL4314V","name":"Private Equity and Venture Capital: Law and Practice","description":"This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the legal issues that arise in private equity and venture capital from both practical and theoretical perspectives. The topics that will be covered explore the laws and practices relating to the whole cycle of the venture capital and private equity, including fundraising, investments, exits, foreign investments and regulation. The course will also discuss equity crowdfunding which is an important emerging method of equity financing. Certain topics of this course will provide relevant comparisons with private equity and venture capital in China, Singapore and the U.S. It will be of interest to legal professionals in the private equity and venture capital sectors."},{"modId":"LL4316V","name":"Restitution of Unjust Enrichment","description":"This course is about the law of restitution for unjust enrichment.

It does not cover all of the law relating to gain-based remedies."},{"modId":"LL4317V","name":"International Arbitration in Asian Centres","description":"This course will give the students an in-depth look at how cases proceed under the SIAC, HKIAC and MCIA rules, with some comparative coverage of the CIETAC and KLRCA rules. Highlighted will be the salient features of these arbitral institutional rules including the introduction of cutting edge procedures such as the emergency arbitrator and expedited arbitration procedures and consolidation/joinder. The course will also provide a comparative analysis of the arbitral legislative framework in Singapore, Hong Kong and India and offer an in-depth analysis, with case studies, of the role of the courts in Singapore, Hong Kong and India in dealing with specific issues such as challenges to tribunal jurisdiction, enforcement and setting aside of awards. Finally, the course will also look at the peculiar relationship between arbitration and mediation in Asia."},{"modId":"LL4318V","name":"Public Health Law and Regulation","description":"This course provides an introduction to important topics in public health law and regulation. It explores the use of law as an important tool in protecting the public’s health, responding to health risks and implementing strategies to promote and improve public health. The course reviews the nature and sources of public health law, and regulatory strategies that law can deploy to protect and promote public health. It considers these roles in selected areas within the field: for example, acute public health threats like SARS and pandemic influenza, tobacco control, serious sexually transmitted diseases, and non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes."},{"modId":"LL4319V","name":"Current Problems in International Law","description":"This course examines current problems in international law relating, for instance, to the use of force, human rights, international environmental law and foreign investment law."},{"modId":"LL4321","name":"Deals: The Economic Structure of Business Transactions","description":"This course applies economic concepts to the practice of structuring business transactions. The materials consist of case studies of actual transactions. We will use those case studies to analyze the economics challenges that parties to a deal must address, and to analyse the mechanisms the parties use to address those challenges. The case studies will cover a selection from bond financings, acquisitions, movie financings, product licenses, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more."},{"modId":"LL4322","name":"Trade Finance Law","description":"Trade Finance Law considers the different legal structures used to effect payment under, and disincentives breaches of, international agreements for the supply of goods and services. The course analyses and compares documentary and standby letters of credit, international drafts and forfaiting, performance bonds and first demand guarantees and export credit guarantees. Key topics will include the structure, juridical nature and obligational content of the aforementioned instruments; the nature of the harmonised regimes and their interaction with domestic law; the principle of strict compliance and its relaxation; documentary and non-documentary forms of recourse; the autonomy principle and its exceptions; and the conflict of laws principles applicable to autonomous payment undertakings. The course should be of interest to students who have already studied other components of international trade and/or who have an interest in international banking operations."},{"modId":"LL4323","name":"Law of Agency","description":"The objective of this course is to familiarise students with the general law of agency. Agency problems are pervasive throughout the law: they are not confined to professional agents nor even to commercial law. We all act through and deal with agents the whole time. In the case of corporations, having no physical personality they can only deal through human agents. Most applications of agency reasoning are in the law of contract, but they also may arise in the law of tort, property and elsewhere."},{"modId":"LL4324","name":"Comparative Trade Mark Law","description":"This module takes a comparative approach to exploring what is meant by a trade mark, the messages that trade marks communicate and the roles they perform. These are important enquiries because questions of what trade marks do and ought to do have a direct impact on the contours of the law. A major theme will be the relationship between trade marks and brands: to what extent should trade mark law be concerned with protecting brand value? What might a focus on brand value mean for competitors? Is a focus on brand value compatible with the logics of trade mark registration? These questions will be explored by reference to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, most significantly Australia, the EU, Singapore and the USA."},{"modId":"LL4325","name":"The Int'l Litigation & Procedure of State Disputes","description":"Taught by two public international law practitioners, this course invites participants to develop a more practical and strategic understanding of how a State deals with the various types of disputes it may face.

The course will conclude with a seminar where senior practitioners of public international law share their views and insights on acting as a Government advisor and as an advocate."},{"modId":"LL4326","name":"Administrative Justice: Perspectives from the U.S.","description":"An introduction to the public law system of the United States, with an emphasis on structural issues and governmental processes, especially the creation of regulations and the political and judicial controls over this important activity. Changes resulting from the Trump administration will be an important element."},{"modId":"LL4327V","name":"Mergers and Acquisitions: A Practitioner’s Perspective","description":"This course will provide a practitioner's perspective on the bread and butter of any transactional practice: mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of non-listed, private companies. It will deal with the structuring of an M&A transaction (the why) and the plain vanilla aspects of documentation (the why and how of basic drafting). Many new graduates seem to be unable to see the wood for the trees. They arrive as trainees, with a reasonable grounding in the law, but an inability to apply it to real life situations. The practicalities elude them and they seem to want to follow templates without much understanding of the transaction. This course will attempt to give them a working knowledge of the issues to be considered in structuring a transaction. It will also cover the main features of standard documentation (bearing in mind that there is a discernible industry-standard set of documentation in common law countries) to explain why documents are drafted the way they are."},{"modId":"LL4328","name":"Sports Law","description":"Sports Law is a very broad field, encompassing several areas of law unique to the sporting industry, as well as several traditional areas of law applied to the field of sport.This course will focus on the existing and evolving private and public international sports law systems, (where appropriate) the national sports law of several jurisdictions (including Australia, USA, UK and to a lesser extent, Singapore) and provide avenues of multi-jurisdictional comparative analysis. The social, political, commercial and economic influences on the development, content and structure of sports law globally will also be explored."},{"modId":"LL4329","name":"Cross-Border Litigation","description":"The focus of this course is on the litigation of cross-border disputes in the fields of tort, contract, consumer protection and intellectual property including in the online context. The subject will examine the key doctrinal principles and scholarly debates in the area as well as problems commonly encountered in practice. Material will be drawn from leading common law jurisdictions, including Singapore, Australia, England, Hong Kong and Canada. The course is recommended for those with an interest in international dispute resolution, conflict of laws, litigation or international commerce."},{"modId":"LL4330","name":"Advanced Trusts Law","description":"The first part of the course explores how trusts are used to manage family wealth, with emphasis on developments in the ‘offshore world’. We will discuss how trusts may be used to protect assets, how trustees’ discretions may be controlled, the rights of objects of trusts, and purpose trusts. The second part concerns trusts in commercial transactions. We will explore creditor trusts, constructive trusts, bonds and intermediated holding of securities, equitable assignments and equitable charges. By comparing commercial trusts with private trusts, we will also ask whether there are any significant contextual differences in relation to the trust device."},{"modId":"LL4331","name":"The Rule of Law","description":"This course explores the ideal of the rule of law: its value, limitations, costs, and relationship with distinct social aspirations. The teaching is based on leading texts, comparative case law, and video documentaries. The course is divided into nine modules: (1) the meaning and value of the rule of law, (2) emergencies, (3) the relationship(s) between the rule of law, the obligation to obey the law, and the rule of good law, (4) the modern welfare state, (5) criminal law vs. private law, (6) international law, (7) corporations and liberal democracy, (8) colonialism and developmental transitions, and (9) defences for disobedience."},{"modId":"LL4332","name":"Fair Use in Theory and Practice","description":"The copyright laws of Singapore and the United have in common a general, flexible, open exception designated by the term “fair use.” During the last 25 years, the U.S has had extensive experience with this concept, both in the courts and in fields of practice as diverse as art, filmmaking, education, technology, and journalism. Not only have judicial opinions about fair used cohered into a “unified field theory” of the doctrine, but awareness of its potential applications has increased dramatically among members of relevant communities. The last development has been attributable in part to the development of community-specific Codes of Best Practices for the responsible application of fair use – an effort in which the instructor for this module has been active. The course will explore the legal background of fair use, its doctrinal evolution over the past 25 years, and a variety of practical situations in which it has been successful employed."},{"modId":"LL4334","name":"Law and Society in Southeast Asia","description":"This module aims to increase students’ breadth of empirical knowledge and depth of theoretical understanding of issues of law, justice, and society. With urbanization and industrialization, modern societies have increasingly depended upon law to regulate the behaviour of their members and the activities of their institutions. It will explore issues in law and society in SE Asia, with an emphasis on how sexuality, ethnic and religious diversity are handled, and how justice is conceived; as well as\nissues in the Singaporean justice system, where other examples will be used to compare Singapore’s unique approach to addressing justice and society issues."},{"modId":"LL4335V","name":"Multinational Enterprises and International Law","description":"This module examines the evolving regime for the regulation and protection of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international law. Although MNEs remain creations of domestic law, the cross-border activities of MNEs increasingly come within the scope of instruments creating obligations and/or rights in international law. In assessing the challenges faced by states and MNEs alike with respect to such transnational regulation, the module takes a rounded and interdisciplinary view of the issues involved, addressing both the commercial and social dimensions of MNE action. In addition to considering the regulatory powers of individual states, developments under international instruments on human rights, labour conditions, finance, taxation and investment are addressed."},{"modId":"LL4338V","name":"Advanced Practicum in International Arbitration","description":"This course introduces students to the real-life practice of international commercial and treaty arbitration from beginning to end: from clause drafting/treaty jurisdiction, to arbitrator selection, to emergency proceedings, through the written and hearing phases, to award and enforcement strategy. Emphasis will be on primary materials: case law, statutes, institution rules, treaties, commentary, and “soft law” guidelines. Using complex factual scenarios, students will take part in strategy, drafting and advocacy exercises. On the commercial arbitration side, the focus will be on the ICC Court and SIAC; on the treaty side, ICSID and the PCA/UNCITRAL. Ethics issues will be front burner."},{"modId":"LL4339","name":"Comparative Evidence in International Arbitration","description":"This course considers the way that international adjudicators approach fact-finding and factual determinations. The course analyses essential policy questions as to the way legal systems should deal with evidence; considers comparative law perspectives; and aims to integrate these perspectives with practical consideration of the way documents and witnesses are dealt with in international arbitration. There is no greater divergence between legal families than that pertaining to the treatment of evidence. For international adjudication to meet the needs of participants from all legal families, a proper understanding of comparative approaches and the degree of convergence, is essential to arbitrators and practitioners."},{"modId":"LL4396","name":"University Research Opportunities Program","description":"This course provides students with the opportunity to do a substantial research paper under the direct supervision of a member of the academic staff.

At the point of needing a theoretical underpinning for the novel concerns of academic law occasioned by globalization, fresh considerations of interdisciplinary perspectives on law are opened up, questioning the extent to which a distinctively legal approach to global issues is possible. This course engages with these challenges by exploring the global interconnectedness of law, morality, politics and economics, and considers what contribution legal theory might make to illuminating complex policy issues with a global reach."},{"modId":"LL5177V","name":"Entertainment Law: Pop Iconography & Celebrity","description":"The objectives of the course are to (i) examine key aspects of a modern entertainment industry with a focus on the enforcement of intellectual property rights relating to popular iconography in movies, books, fashion and the arts; (ii) critically evaluate claims brought by celebrities, authors, artists and well-known brands in the United States and United Kingdom; (iii) understand the current legal issues concerning the protection of the commercial and dignitary interests of the celebrity.

It is, arguably, the most consequential legal event in the evolution of Western Civilization. We will examine the historical, political, and legal background to the Trial, and, especially, the procedural propriety of the Trial. Questions to be explored include: Were hisprocedural rights preserved during his trial before the Sanhedrin? Was histrial a miscarriage of justice?

It will lead to an understanding of shared principles of civil law jurisdictions and emphasize important differences to common law systems."},{"modId":"LL5235V","name":"Government Contracts: Int'l & Comparative Perspectives","description":"Today, many governments, like individuals and business entities, enter into contracts. The growing phenomenon of government contracts, especially contracts concluded with foreign nationals, refutes the traditional belief that contract is the domain of private law. This course offers an in-depth examination on how the presence of a government as a proper party to a contract moves the entire analysis on contract formation, performance, breach and dispute settlement to the domains of public law and general international law.

Examples will be central banks from Singapore, China, Japan and Europe."},{"modId":"LL5242V","name":"Financial Regulation and Central Banking","description":"The course will include various aspects of financial regulation. The focus will be on the regulation of credit institutions and the role of central banks. Other forms of regulation of financial intermediaries and financial markets will be discussed in less detail. Since the focus will be on credit institutions, it will be important that the students understand what distinguishes credit institutions from other providers of financial services and how the regulatory approaches differ. The part on the regulation of credit institutions will include requirements for their authorization, their permanent supervision and rescue scenarios in situations of insolvency and default. These aspects will be discussed from a comparative perspective with the Basel requirements at the core of the discussion, complemented by the implementing norms in important jurisdictions, above all in Singapore. For resolution and restructuring the European Union has taken on a leading role, and, as a consequence, these EU approaches will be analysed in detail. The roles of central banks will remain a core part of the course. Their tasks and objectives will be discussed from a comparative perspective. Their essential role in crisis management, their co-operation with supervisory agencies and their monetary policy will remain essential components of the course."},{"modId":"LL5244V","name":"Criminal Practice","description":"The administration of criminal justice in Singapore relies on an ethical, professional and skilled disposition and management of criminal cases.

Major topics to be covered include general concepts of secured transactions, specific security and quasi-security devices over chattels and choses in action, the main themes of corporate rescue law and corporate rescue mechansims."},{"modId":"LL5295","name":"Conflict of Laws in Int’l Commercial Arbitration","description":"This course will focus in detail on the instances in which resort to conflict of laws is necessary in the international arbitration context. The objective of this course is to allow participants to realise on how many occasions both State courts and arbitrators will need to report a conflict of laws analysis despite the claim that conflict of laws issues are not relevant in the international commercial arbitration context. Participants will first be taught to identify what conflict of laws rules may apply and will then be given hypothetical cases and will be asked to critically examine whether a solution can be found that does not require a conflict of laws approach."},{"modId":"LL5299","name":"Advanced Issues in the Law & Practice of Int’l Arbitration","description":"This intensive course is designed for students and\npractitioners already acquainted with the fundamentals of\ninternational arbitration, and may be particularly useful for\nthose who may have an inclination to specialize in the\npractice or study of international dispute resolution.

Most law seeks to regulate, incentivize and nudge people to behave in some ways and not in others – it seeks to shape human behavior. Traditional economic analysis of law is committed to the assumption that people are fully rational, but empirical evidence suggests that people very often exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This course about behavioural law and economics, with an emphasis on regulation, looks at the implications of actual, not hypothesized, human behaviour for the law. It considers, in particular, how using the mildest forms of interventions, law can steer people’s choices in welfarepromoting directions."},{"modId":"LL5309","name":"The Practical Realities of Dis","description":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes. However, resolving disputes through either of these methods makes absolutely no sense if they do not yield a result that is effectively enforceable. The Asean Region, China and India have different cultures to dispute resolution. The New York Convention for enforcing international arbitral awards has been ratified by more than 150 countries but not been harmoniously interpreted by State Courts.

Case studies used will range from traditional institutions such as the UN and its specialised agencies, to newer institutions such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."},{"modId":"LL5313V","name":"Mediation/Conciliation of Inter- & Investor-State Disputes","description":"Recent years have witnessed more state-to-state and investor-state disputes, with a substantial increase in resources spent on binding arbitration. Mediation and conciliation are rarely attempted and more rarely successful. This course introduces the student to methods of mediation and conciliation on the international law plane, and surveys existing institutional regimes (ie, ICSID, PCA, SIAC). The focus will then turn to identification and critical analysis of the special legal and policy obstacles to voluntary dispute settlement by states (including SOEs), as well as countervailing incentives.

Most applications of agency reasoning are in the law of contract, but they also may arise in the law of tort, property and elsewhere."},{"modId":"LL5324","name":"Comparative Trade Mark Law","description":"This module takes a comparative approach to exploring what is meant by a trade mark, the messages that trade marks communicate and the roles they perform. These are important enquiries because questions of what trade marks do and ought to do have a direct impact on the contours of the law. A major theme will be the relationship between trade marks and brands: to what extent should trade mark law be concerned with protecting brand value? What might a focus on brand value mean for competitors? Is a focus on brand value compatible with the logics of trade mark registration? These questions will be explored by reference to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, most significantly Australia, the EU, Singapore and the USA."},{"modId":"LL5325","name":"The Int'l Litigation & Procedure of State Disputes","description":"Taught by two public international law practitioners, this course invites participants to develop a more practical and strategic understanding of how a State deals with the various types of disputes it may face.

It will lead to an understanding of shared principles of civil law jurisdictions and emphasize important differences to common law systems."},{"modId":"LL6235V","name":"Government Contracts: Int'l & Comparative Perspectives","description":"Today, many governments, like individuals and business entities, enter into contracts. The growing phenomenon of government contracts, especially contracts concluded with foreign nationals, refutes the traditional belief that contract is the domain of private law. This course offers an in-depth examination on how the presence of a government as a proper party to a contract moves the entire analysis on contract formation, performance, breach and dispute settlement to the domains of public law and general international law. It also offers critical perspectives on the mooted confluence of comparative public law and international law to obtain bespoke rules and principles for the regulation of government contracts."},{"modId":"LL6237V","name":"Law, Institutions, and Business in Greater China","description":"This module aims to explore the interaction between legal institutions and economic/business development in Greater China (i.e. China, Taiwan, HK), with focus on China. How has China been able to offset institutional weaknesses at home while achieving impressive economic results worldwide?

This course reviews theories about market development in the context of Greater China, including securities, corporate regulations, capital markets, property, sovereign wealth funds, foreign investment, and anticorruption etc."},{"modId":"LL6242V","name":"Financial Regulation and Central Banking","description":"The course will include various aspects of financial regulation. The focus will be on the regulation of credit institutions and the role of central banks. Other forms of regulation of financial intermediaries and financial markets will be discussed in less detail. Since the focus will be on credit institutions, it will be important that the students understand what distinguishes credit institutions from other providers of financial services and how the regulatory approaches differ. The part on the regulation of credit institutions will include requirements for their authorization, their permanent supervision and rescue scenarios in situations of insolvency and default. These aspects will be discussed from a comparative perspective with the Basel requirements at the core of the discussion, complemented by the implementing norms in important jurisdictions, above all in Singapore. For resolution and restructuring the European Union has taken on a leading role, and, as a consequence, these EU approaches will be analysed in detail. The roles of central banks will remain a core part of the course. Their tasks and objectives will be discussed from a comparative perspective. Their essential role in crisis management, their co-operation with supervisory agencies and their monetary policy will remain essential components of the course."},{"modId":"LL6244V","name":"Criminal Practice","description":"The administration of criminal justice in Singapore relies on an ethical, professional and skilled disposition and management of criminal cases.

First, it compares international commercial arbitration (ICA) international investment arbitration (ISA). Second, it focuses on the evolution of arbitration, in particular, on the development of the procedures and substantive law that have gradually enabled arbitration to become a meaningfully autonomous legal system. Third, it surveys a variety of explanations for why the arbitral order has evolved as it has – into a more “judicial-like” legal order – focusing on the role of arbitral centres, state regulatory competition, and the reasoning of tribunals in their awards."},{"modId":"LL6292V","name":"State Responsibility: Theory and Practice","description":"The law governing the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts is absolutely central in public international law and cuts across various sub-fields of that discipline. This seminar investigates the fundamental tenets of the law of State responsibility, both from theoretical and practical standpoints, while tracing some of its historical roots.

Most law seeks to regulate, incentivize and nudge people to behave in some ways and not in others – it seeks to shape human behavior. Traditional economic analysis of law is committed to the assumption that people are fully rational, but empirical evidence suggests that people very often exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This course about behavioural law and economics, with an emphasis on regulation, looks at the implications of actual, not hypothesized, human behaviour for the law. It considers, in particular, how using the mildest forms of interventions, law can steer people’s choices in welfarepromoting directions."},{"modId":"LL6309","name":"The Practical Realities of Dispute Resolution in Asia","description":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes. However, resolving disputes through either of these methods makes absolutely no sense if they do not yield a result that is effectively enforceable. The Asean Region, China and India have different cultures to dispute resolution. The New York Convention for enforcing international arbitral awards has been ratified by more than 150 countries but not been harmoniously interpreted by State Courts. The region is also famously known for Guerrilla tactics to scuttle effective dispute resolution. This course aims to set out the practical realities of enforcing court judgments, arbitral awards and mediation settlements."},{"modId":"LL6310V","name":"International Organisations in International Law","description":"This seminar-style module critically examines the impact of international organisations on the formal structures of international law.

Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism."},{"modId":"PH3204","name":"Issues in Indian Philosophy","description":"ISSUES IN INDIAN PHILOSOPHY"},{"modId":"PH3206","name":"Recent Philosophy","description":"This module looks at the development of twentieth century analytic philosophy through the works of some of its major exponents. These include Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Moore, Austin and Quine. The fundamental assumption in analytic philosophy is the idea that all philosophical problems are really problems of language and may be solved either by reformulating them in a perfect language or by a better understanding of the language that we actually speak. One of the aims of this course is to show how certain problems in ethics, metaphysics and epistemology may be solved (or dissolved) through the careful analysis of language and meaning."},{"modId":"PH3216","name":"Comparative Environmental Ethics","description":"This module examines how various traditions, both East and West, perceive the relationship between humans and the natural world. It will compare how, e.g., Christianity, the secular West, Hinduism, Taoism and Confucianism conceive of this relation. Commonalities and differences in the respective approaches will be discussed and highlighted. Environmental issues are now in the forefront of global attention. Our current environmental problems may arguably be said to ultimately trace their roots to (implicit) metaphysical assumptions, to cultural or religious attitudes towards the natural world, to ethical perspectives that do not accord moral consideration to non-humans."},{"modId":"PH3217","name":"Women in Philosophy","description":"This module deals with philosophy by women (eg Christine de Pisan, Hildegaard von Bingen, Mary Wollstonecraft, Ban Zhao, Iris Murdoch, Martha Nussbaum) and philosophy about women, to counter the perceived neglect of these in many philosophical discourses. Students are encouraged to reflect critically about their own experiences as men and women who live in a gendered world, to think through the implications of gender: how women's experience may challenge some fundamental assumptions regarding human nature, femininity and masculinity, sexuality and the body, public and private life, subjectivity and representation. We will explore how these challenges to philosophy may be met."},{"modId":"PH3230","name":"Normative Ethical Theory","description":"This module is a study of the main contending contemporary views about goodness and virtue, principles of moral evaluation, and moral decision-making. These include deontological, consequentialist, and contemporary virtuebased and contractarian theories. Emphasis will be placed on securing a thorough understanding the arguments used to derive fundamental moral principles and to justify claims about our moral obligations. Such study aims to reveal the kinds of issues that are involved in analyzing what constitutes rational considerations for moral action, and the strengths and weaknesses of the rival theories."},{"modId":"PH3241","name":"Consciousness","description":"One of the main problems of consciousness concerns whether consciousness can be explained solely in terms of brain activity and the like. Some philosophers think so. After all, science has successfully explained various cognitive functions in such terms, and it’s natural to think that its success will eventually extend to consciousness. Other philosophers disagree, finding it hard to fathom how consciousness can arise from the purely physical. To help us decide which answer is correct, we shall examine various important positions on the nature of consciousness including physicalism, dualism, eliminativism, and idealism."},{"modId":"PH3243","name":"Chance and Uncertainty","description":"We often appeal to probabilistic notions in everyday life. We say things such as ‘It’ll probably rain later’, ‘It’s unlikely that an asteroid will collide with Earth any time soon’, and ‘There’s a chance that the restaurant will be open’. But what exactly is probability? We shall investigate various answers to this question by looking at various theories of probability, including the subjective theory, the epistemic theory, the frequency theory, and the propensity theory. Along the way, we’ll see how issues in the philosophy of probability bear on issues in the philosophy of science, metaphysics, and epistemology."},{"modId":"PH3244","name":"Appearance and Reality","description":"Plato holds that the world of sensible objects is a mere shadow of an ideal realm that transcends experience. Locke maintains that sensible objects have intrinsic natures that are exhausted by a small number of basic spatial and temporal properties. Kant argues that we can never know the natures of things in themselves, beyond the fact that they give us certain senseimpressions. Mill construes a physical object as a bare propensity for sensations to occur in certain patterns. In this module, students engage with the major metaphysical systems of Western philosophy, examining how each coordinates subjective experience with objective reality."},{"modId":"PH3245","name":"Language and Thought","description":"Topics at the intersection of philosophy of mind and language, such as whether thought depends on talk or vice versa, whether we think in words or images, whether those words are words of English or a sui generis mental language just for thinking, whether animals which can’t talk can think and whether the mind is like a computer. These questions are central to contemporary philosophy and language and are also an important case study in the relationship between the methods of analysis, experiment and introspection in philosophical psychology."},{"modId":"PH3246","name":"Paradoxes","description":"This module is a survey of classic paradoxes, ancient and modern. No mere brain-teasers, these riddles have exercised some of history’s best minds, often with startling results. How is motion possible? What is a gamble at given odds worth? Is time travel possible? Why do nations honor their treaty obligations? What are numbers? The contemplation of paradoxes drives the search for answers to these questions and more, and by grappling with the paradoxes, students gain familiarity with key techniques and concepts of decision theory and logical analysis which are useful both in philosophy and other fields of inquiry."},{"modId":"PH3247","name":"Philosophical Logic","description":"In classical logic, every sentence is either true or false, every argument with contradictory premises or a tautologous conclusion is valid, and every conditional with a false antecedent or true consequent is true. In this course, we explore non-classical logics which weaken these assumptions, including but not limited to various many-valued, modal and relevant logics, along with the philosophical questions they raise and answer."},{"modId":"PH3261","name":"Kant's Critique of Pure Reason","description":"Kant is widely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers, if not the greatest, and his Critique of Pure Reason is widely considered his greatest work. This course will delve into this work, entering into the intricate framework of Kant’s Transcendental Idealism. Major topics include Space and Time, the Categories, the Analogies (focusing on causation) and the Antinomies (focusing on the issue of freedom). Although the course focuses primarily on Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology, this grounding is expected to improve one’s understanding of the basis of Kant’s ethics, particularly when dealing with the Transcendental Dialectic."},{"modId":"PH3301","name":"Classical Chinese Philosophy II","description":"This is the second part of a two part course which offers an introduction to philosophical debate in the Warring States period of ancient China, the Classical Age of Chinese Philosophy and the seedbed from which grew all of the native currents of thought that survived from traditional China. Continuing from Part I, we will be discussing Later Mohist Logic, Gongsun Long and other ‘Sophists’, Zhuangzi, Xunzi and Hanfeizi in this module. The approach of the course will be both historical and critical, and we will attempt to both situate Classical Chinese philosophical discourse in its intellectual-historical context and to bring out its continuing relevance."},{"modId":"PH4203","name":"Issues in Moral Philosophy","description":"This module examines different issues in meta-ethics or normative ethics. It asks questions such as: Can ought be derived from is? Are there natural laws? Is morality about an agent’s character or actions?

Modern scholarship has been slowly dismantling this myth, revealing Hobbes as one of the most profound thinkers in the English language. His metaphysical understanding of reality as matter in motion underpinned a systematic philosophy of the natural world and the place of human beings in it which gave particular attention to the linguistic and ethical problems which needed to be overcome in order to create a political community; the notorious ‘Leviathan’."},{"modId":"PS4219","name":"Comparative Political Thought","description":"This course will explore the emerging field of comparative political theory by considering to what extent it stands as a coherent, independent subfield, and what if any are the questions it is specifically poised to answer. Our treatment will be both topical and methodological. We will begin by reading the work of contemporary scholars who explicitly situate themselves within “comparative” as opposed to mainstream canonical political theory, and/or who use comparison as a tool for elucidating particular political problems.

Issues of format, scope, and participation in collective bargaining will be addressed, as will principal-agent and other collective action logics."},{"modId":"PS4881D","name":"Topics in CP: Money and Politics","description":"This seminar examines the relationship between private wealth and political power. Most polities claim to pursue public ends, yet many leaders have close links to private money. In democracies, elections are supposed to produce accountable officials, yet campaigns depend on funding from corporations and individuals. This module addresses questions about the ‘dirty’ side of politics and how private financing of political campaigns could be regulated: Why does vote-buying occur in some situations but not others? What is the role of organised crime in the business-politics nexus? How representative are elected leaders if they are also indebted to campaign financiers? These themes have wide relevance and we will study them in a variety of contexts, from local struggles in the developing world to American presidential elections."},{"modId":"PS4882F","name":"The Politics of International Trade","description":"This module is designed as a research seminar for upper-level Political Science majors.

This module is a comparative study of deviance with a focus on empirical case studies. “Nuts, sluts, perverts” is Alexander Liazo’s phrase to refer to deviants from below like mental patients, sex workers and sexual outlaws. “Scandals” involve deviance from above, committed by authorities such as clergy abuse, official corruption and corporate malfeasance. Analyzing the range of underdog and elite forms of deviance in terms of disparities in their social constructions, criminal processing and dispensing of justice would enhance our understanding of structures of inequality and power."},{"modId":"SC3230","name":"Civil Society and Civic Engagement","description":"Civil society is not possible without voluntarily engaging citizens and the culture of civic engagement in the form of volunteerism is hard to grow in a milieu that lacks a tradition of democratic civil society. Given that civic engagement and volunteerism are perceived as a crucial indicator of liveable society, it has been a concern of many countries including Singapore to increase voluntary associations and promote volunteering among citizens. This module thus pursues three main themes: (1) the relationship between civil society and civic engagement, (2) the precursors of volunteers (i.e., what makes people volunteer?), and (3) the outcomes of volunteerism (e.g., life satisfaction, health, or status attainment)."},{"modId":"SC3551","name":"FASS Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP)","description":"A UROP involves the student working with a supervisor, and usually in a team, on an existing research project.

This module is mounted for students with a keen interest in social theories."},{"modId":"SC4202","name":"Reading Ethnographies","description":"Ethnography (the description of a social context) involves both fieldwork, and writing about it - a process recently subject to intense debate and critique. We examine the tensions between fieldwork, the crafting of the text (the ethnography), and its reception within the discipline of anthropology. Following the `writing culture' debate, we aim to understand how ethnographers `construct' data, frame their analysis, and produce a text. We examine ethnographic `realism' as a style, how styles have changed over time, and how differently some researchers have written about the same culture area. The course will heighten students' critical skills and their awareness of how any representation of social reality has been put together."},{"modId":"SC4203","name":"Sociology of Organizations","description":"This module deals with exciting theoretical and practical issues in the sociology of organizations. Some of the questions addressed are (1) What kind of 'animal' is this creature called organization? (2) What are its key characteristics: structure, culture, environment?

Not just for individuals, but for all kinds of social groups, memory is an indissoluble part of identity. Remembering is always a selective reconstruction, hence always political. 'Popular' (often oral) memory interacts with 'official' history, while itself containing differences relating to generation, class, gender and ethnicity. Memories of traumatic events of the C20th shape our moral universe and are driving developments in international human rights law. Our explorations of the politics of memory will be grounded in case studies of both regional and global relevance."},{"modId":"SC4217","name":"Social Movements and Collective Behaviour","description":"The course focuses on developing a framework for constructing and rethinking factors (be they economic, political, cultural) that have led to the emergence, development, and maintenance of certain forms of collective behaviour.

First, an important goal of the module is to clarify the extent to which mental and physical health/illness have been socially constructed and unevenly distributed in society. The module further identifies the effects of such social conditions as socioeconomic status, education, gender, and social networks on patterns of health inequality. Finally, it delves into specific issues like social epidemiology, stress process, and health care where possible causal relationships between a variety of social forces and health/illness are explored."},{"modId":"SC4226","name":"Cultural Production: Power, Voice, Policies","description":"This module considers cultural production as an arena of contestation for voice and visibility. It explores how creative performances and productions have been used to express, subvert, or redefine social realities and values, constitute publics, and initiate change. A variety of forms, such as street theatres, music, cartoons, community and online media, will be explored through an anthropological engagement with the everyday politics of recognition, narration, belonging, and indeed the valuation of one’s voice. Power, performance, agency, creativity, audiences, art worlds and aesthetics are among the key concepts explored."},{"modId":"SC4227","name":"Gender, Sex and Power","description":"All societies are organized around gender and sexuality. Everywhere, the sex/gender system has implications for the relative power of men and women in society. Human societies have a tendency toward patriarchy. Some societies are relatively gender-egalitarian. Others are strongly patriarchal. But none are strongly matriarchal. This module examines the social, cultural, psychological and biological arguments, including feminist and non-feminist theories for how and why sex and gender relate to the distribution of power in society. It examines these questions in terms of broad comparison across cultures, in evolutionary history, in modern state societies and in today’s transnational, globalizing world."},{"modId":"SC4228","name":"Making Sense of Violence","description":"What is violence? How is violence materialized, contested and reproduced? What can anthropology offer to understandings of violence? Exploring phenomena ranging from war, genocide and terrorism to domestic abuse, poverty and crime, this course examines violence as a domain of cultural understanding and a mode of social action. Involving both overt and spectacular expressions and implicit and everyday forms, our understandings of violence will span the intimacy of the family, the nationalisms of states and the economics of global corporations. Through the comparison of cross-cultural ethnographies, we look critically at the theoretical, empirical, methodological and ethical implications of analysing violence."},{"modId":"SC4401","name":"Honours Thesis","description":"This module requires students to conduct an independent research project on an approved topic under the supervision of an academic staff.

These two skills are inseparably linked: they are two sides of the same coin. A poorly designed project or programme will have very little chance of successfully competing for funds, while an innovative, well-conceived project will never get funded unless it gets written into a good proposal. A good programme design in a good proposal can lead to better implementation and management, and sets the stage for good monitoring and evaluation. In turn, a project executed well has better chances for re-funding and expansion by donors. This skills building design, monitoring and evaluation (DME) course is designed to introduce the potential proposal writer to the working environment that he will eventually confront repeatedly.

The module aims to provide an introduction to the field of quantum computing. While very much a technology of the future, the module will examine some of the possibilities that the quantum world offers in advancing the capabilities of computers and how our notion of information has evolved. Essentially the module showcases, two major paradigm shifts; one from classical physics to quantum physics and the other from the standard Turing principle in computer science to its modern quantum counterpart."},{"modId":"ULS2202","name":"Evolution","description":"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of Evolution This bold statement by the Russian population geneticist T. Dobzhansky emphasizes the importance of evolution as the only unifying concept in biology. Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\")."},{"modId":"ULS2206","name":"The Doors of Perception: Biology, Technology & Culture","description":"When we open our eyes, we feel that we are seeing the world as it is in front of us. But scientific studies reveal that we are seeing only a tiny fraction of that world, and that what we do see (and hear, and smell, and touch) is not the world “as it is” – but as it is represented to us through the filters of our biology, or technology, and our culture. This module will examine the ways in which these three important forces enable, limit and shape the ways that we perceive “the world in front of us”."},{"modId":"ULS2207","name":"The Biology and Phenomenology of Pain","description":"When asked, “what is pain?” many respond: “the response to something painful.” That answer is tautological. To escape tautology, we need to understand pain independent of any stimulus; we need to understand pain subjectively. A subjective focus, however, causes problems. The need for subjectivity might deny pain to the unborn and to animals, and seemingly leads to the conclusion that we can “think” ourselves into, and out of, pain. Consequently, many argue that pain should be understood objectively as the expression of biological changes (hormonal increases, brain activity) that are mobilised to defend the organism from injury."},{"modId":"ULT2298D","name":"Representing War","description":"War is the greatest common, man-made trauma that human beings undergo. We imagine war before, during and after we fight it. We imagine it socially, as tribes or nations, generating a common understanding through books, movies, songs and other representations. Those shared visions of war enable us to fight it and confront its trauma. This module examines the changing imagination of war across history. Focusing mainly on English-speaking cultures, it examines poems, books, films, songs, plays, news reports, letters, speeches and tv programmes. It asks how they represent war, and how representations change over time and under pressure from technology, events and political thought."},{"modId":"UNL2206","name":"Nature's Threads","description":"This module seeks to explore the importance of various key ideas in the history of physics by considering a selection of examples each semester as a means of examining the whys and hows of certain scientific revolutions. The theme underlying the choice of topics to be covered will be to explore the evolutionary aspect of scientific understanding which finds inter-connections (often, only much later, sometimes even centuries later) between seemingly unrelated ideas. The student should take away from this module a sense of the revolutionary nature and scientific importance of the ideas explored that semester, as well as the deep inter-connections which science establishes - 'Nature's Threads' as it were."},{"modId":"UNL2207","name":"The Nature of Natural Law","description":"This module examines the evolution of our present theoretical understanding of some basic aspects of the physical world around us. It explores the role of certain primitive concepts of science and how these key ideas have been used to construct a coherent ‘mental’ picture of the physical world. The particular focus this semester will be on a wellestablished and ‘deterministic’ law of nature: the Law of Universal Gravity and how this led to Newton’s prediction of the motion of the planets. The module will also question, on a higher level, the nature of ‘scientific explanations’: how these are extended over time and inevitably get modified by having to take into account new ‘facts’ provided by observation and experiment."},{"modId":"UNL2210","name":"Mathematics and Reality","description":"What is the nature of Reality and how can we be sure about what we know? Do mathematical constructs such as symmetry groups and infinity point beyond themselves to a higher reality? How do we account for the fact that mathematics is so effective in describing nature? Is it mere language or is it the reality itself? This module explores the intimate link between reality and mathematics and how the latter has been unreasonably effective in providing a description of nature. Students will be taken through a journey that showcases the developments that have shaped our current views on the topic."},{"modId":"UPC2204","name":"Living Green","description":"As a nation and as a global society, we face a number of environmental issues that impact the quality and even sustainability of our lives and lifestyles. As educated and informed global citizens we need to be aware of these issues. In this course, the students will investigate a few of these issues in detail, exploring the causes, complexities, diverse viewpoints, and possible solutions.

At once celebrated and contested, Singapore’s multiculturalism is imbued with various themes and meanings, and poses many important issues and challenges central to personal, group and national cultural identities as well as to political, economic and social life. How did it come to be a core principle in nation-building? What are state imperatives and social processes and state imperatives in its historical making and constant remaking? Why are race, language and religion its core constitutive elements and how have their saliency evolved over time? What are its main controversial features and areas of tensions, and how do these affect identities, social relations between individuals, groups and communities, and impact social cohesion, citizenship and belonging? How is it further impacted by massive immigration? Is its present official form still valid in light of immigration, changing demographics and competing claims of rights and responsibilities? What does multiculturalism mean in citizens’ memories of the past, experiences in their present everyday lives, and imaginings of the future? This module explores and discusses these central questions and significant dimensions, issues and problems in Singapore’s contested multiculturalism through a combination of lectures, seminars, on-site learning, research projects, class presentations and personal reflections. It also has a strong research component in which students discover and understand multiculturalism through research on selected topics using a variety of research methods, and relate their research and other observations to readings drawn from various disciplines of anthropology, sociology, history, economics, geography, heritage studies and memory studies."},{"modId":"USE2320","name":"Transitional Justice and War Crimes Trials: Case Studies from Singapore and Asia","description":"War crimes trials are commonly used to address mass violence and facilitate political transition. This course examines the potential and limits of war crimes trials as transitional mechanisms, comparing them with non-legal complements and alternatives. What transitional objectives do these trials seek to achieve and how do these trials contribute to a society’s political transition? Given the many pressing and conflicting needs of post-war societies or societies in transition, should the organisation of such trials be prioritised? What are possible alternative transitional measures? What role should the law play, if at all? Using Singapore’s Second World War experience as a central case study, this module will explore the challenges faced by societies undergoing political transition and the different legal and non-legal measures adopted."},{"modId":"USE2321","name":"Examining Local Lives","description":"Everyone hears advice, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. Yet how often do we examine Singaporean lives across print, history, visuals, current events, movement\nand more? This integrative module explores lives across media in search of local roots and routes. The goal is to articulate local lives with an eye to Singapore’s past and its future agencies, including your own.\nFirst, we examine fictional Singaporean lives. Then, we study the ‘life’ of a creation with global impact: a video, say, or song. This module investigates analytical modes,\nas well as expressive and critical narration, that inform stakes we plant."},{"modId":"USP3501","name":"The Problematic Concept Of 'Gender'","description":"What is \"gender\"? What kinds of definitions have been advanced or implied for this perplexing word? How have thinkers - in fields as diverse as anthropology, history, literature, philosophy, psychology, science studies, and sociology - helped to define and even invent this category that we call \"gender\"? How have these definitions changed the way we think? What kinds of problems have these definitions created? In this module, we will analyse various moments in intellectual history when there has been a struggle over the meaning of \"gender\" (and seemingly related terms like \"sex\" and \"sexuality\") in order to understand the term's function as a category of analysis."},{"modId":"USR4002A","name":"Intellectual Responsibility in a Complex World","description":"This course prepares students for intellectual life beyond the university by modelling and asking students to engage in responsible reading, thinking, teaching, writing, and dialogue.

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given.

In seeking the truth, one must often judge a proffered proof. This seminar will discuss the relationship between Truth and Proof in biology, ecology, history, justice, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, physics, religion, statistics, etc. This helps the student see both the hard, objective formulation of the two concepts in the sciences, as well as their soft, subjective abstraction in the humanities."},{"modId":"UTC1112B","name":"Jr Sem Special Topics: Quality Journalism and Critical Reading","description":"News reports that purport to have marshalled facts and opinion on current issues are often taken at face value: they are consumed without question. How can we discern quality journalism from the less worthy instances of the craft? This seminar, led by an experienced journalist, is organised around the critical exploration of key aspects of journalistic writing: the questions behind the story, the use of numbers and the organisation of the message or argument. By dissecting media coverage of current issues, students will bolster their skills as critical readers and communicators."},{"modId":"UTC1117","name":"Junior Seminar: Radiation and Society","description":"Reports of radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan, following the earthquake/tsunami disaster in 2011, have triggered concern and even panic among members of the general public. In this seminar, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to debates and controversies about radiation and nuclear technology. Key topics include: (1) the science behind radiation effects, and the way in which policymakers and others grapple with scientific uncertainties; (2) the challenges of expert-lay communication about radiation risk, both after nuclear disaster and relating to consumer technologies; (3) the broader context that shapes debates over nuclear power in Japan and elsewhere."},{"modId":"UTC1118","name":"Junior Seminar: The Social Lives of Drugs","description":"This junior seminar explores the relationship between drugs and culture. Drugs are powerful because of their material and symbolic value, their power to alter bodies and minds, and their ability to both harm and heal. By examining the social lives of drugs, from production to consumption, students will build the skills to critically ask how drugs affect lives across different societies. Besides the question how a plant, food, or substance becomes constituted as a drug in the first place, topics to be explored include the use of human subjects in clinical drug trials, the ‘pharmaceuticalization’ of health, and licit/illicit drugs."},{"modId":"UTC1402","name":"Jr Sem: Generation Y: Transitions to Adulthood","description":"This course explores the changes in the life transition from adolescence to adulthood in today’s developed world. We will look at some of the popular understandings of emerging adulthood by studying an age group of people called “adultolescents”, “twixters”, or “kippers”.

Finally, we reflect on the kind of citizens these emerging adults are becoming, how they can engage in the community, and what the future holds for them."},{"modId":"UTC1403","name":"Jr Sem: Hidden Communities","description":"There are various ‘hidden communities’ in Singapore that do not gain much public attention but whose members require special consideration from society. People with disabilities, children with learning difficulties, the elderly or migrant workers are among them. They face distinct challenges to live independent and productive lives. Each semester, the module focuses on one specific group and examines that group’s challenges, and best practices in Singaporean and international contexts. Engaging with hidden communities in Singapore is one of the key features of understanding global issues in a local context, so-called ‘Glocalisation’ (globalisation + localisation) to form active citizenship in a healthy society."},{"modId":"UTC1404","name":"Jr Sem: Power and Ideas","description":"According to cultural theorists like Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault and Antonio Gramsci, the structures that support dominant ideas in society could be political, economic, religious or cultural, among others. This module examines the power structures behind the dominant ideas of our time, asking why these structures have an interest in promoting or discrediting ideas about what is ‘good’ for our community and mankind. These ideas include human rights, citizenship, democracy, meritocracy, the ‘Washington Consensus,’ development, age of majority, and political correctness."},{"modId":"UTC1408","name":"Jr Sem: Technology and Human Progress","description":"Technology is the creation and use of tools, techniques and processes to solve a problem or perform a specific function. In this junior seminar, students will explore and understand emergent technologies (informational, biomedical, assistive, instructional etc) and will seek to understand technologies from multidisciplinary perspectives. Students will pursue a specific area of interest (eg a specific new technology, and related ethical or legal issues) in-depth, and consider the potential implications of the widespread use of these technologies, both in advancing human progress; and the social, ethical and legal dilemmas they may pose to society."},{"modId":"UTC1415","name":"Jr Sem: Family in a Changing Singapore","description":"Family is often considered the foundation of society. Families affect the way we live, play, and work, shaping our values and how we relate to others. In this module, students will investigate and engage with issues that surround and\ndefine what it means to be a Singaporean family in the 21st century. They will look at issues such as broken and singleparent families, foster care, family leisure, family businesses etc - through economic, social, and psychological perspectives.

Comprising qualitative and quantitative elements, this module will hone students’ ability to engage in Systems Thinking: understanding parts of a system, seeing interconnections, asking ‘what-if’ questions, quantifying the\neffects of specific interventions and using such understanding to propose operational/structural policies courageously and creatively. Interactive discussions and hands-on computer modelling using examples from several ecological and natural resource systems will serve as the primary learning mechanisms."},{"modId":"UTC1702B","name":"Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare","description":"Does a virus attack any individual? Or, does an individual create conditions for infection? How should hospitals plan treatment strategies and patient-staff movements during an outbreak? Should government allocate more resources\nto prevent onset of chronic diseases rather than managing the complications arising out of chronic diseases? Students will approach such questions from a systems perspective, which involves: understanding behaviours of subsytems and stakeholders such as disease/ infection, patients, providers, payers and society. They will also learn how the interdependencies and interactions between the different actors of the system can be integrated into a holistic system that enables better understanding."},{"modId":"UTC1702C","name":"Thinking in Systems: Sustainability and Us","description":"How does our day-to-day actions and living habits affect our\nenvironment?

Students will analyze these\nquestions from a systems perspective by developing\nqualitative and quantitative models that can map the\ninterconnections and interdependencies between\nstakeholders involved in current sustainability challenges\nfacing humanity (examples: energy consumption, zero\nwaste and recycling). In this module, students will not only\ndevelop a good understanding on sustainability challenges,\nbut also on how actions of individuals can add up to cause\nsuch challenges."},{"modId":"UTC1702D","name":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","description":"Many of the world’s problems are linked to population changes: rapidly aging population, immigration woes, and the threat of environmental degradation to human existence. In this module, students will be introduced to population trends and be equipped to better understand fertility, mortality and migration and how they cause changes in population size, composition and distribution. It incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics. Students will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios."},{"modId":"UTC1702E","name":"Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems","description":"Are energy sources infinite? Do energy policies lead to a sustainable energy development? Would renewables solve our future energy needs, mitigate emissions and protect our environment? Students deal with such energy challenges by learning to understand ‘energy systems’ as a ‘complex whole’. This module provides a platform for students to understand the complex behavior arising from interdependent interactions of different actors of energy systems with other economic, political, social, technological and environmental factors. To achieve this, it engages students to learn and apply systems thinking tools to such aforementioned challenges through relevant models, case studies and real-world energy policy/problem scenarios."},{"modId":"UTC2102","name":"Climate Change","description":"This ‘Senior Seminar’ is required of students in their second year of residence in Tembusu College.

The idea that smart minds are essential for survival has shaped domestic policies and international positioning strategies. We ask: in what ways has human intelligence been defined, measured and harnessed? What counts as intelligence, and what does not? Beyond notions of intelligence centred on the human individual, we will also consider forms of collective and artificial intelligence, mediated by science and technology. What kinds of intelligence are needed for the future and how can Singapore develop them?"},{"modId":"UTS2400","name":"Identities in Asia","description":"This course explores identity-formation in Asia from topdown and bottom-up perspectives, by looking at how authorities, communities and individuals construct their collective identities. The concept of ‘identity’ is a contentious site as it deals with issues of belonging, imagining communities and defining one’s trajectory (identity-formation).

Are they objective copies or artistic transformations of the world? Is photography a democratic art, accessible to all, or is it an instrument of surveillance and social control? What other social purposes does photography serve? We will address these questions and more by discussing the work of photography critics and by examining documentary, advertising, fashion, art, archival, and amateur photography."},{"modId":"UTW1001M","name":"Sport and competition","description":"In professional, competitive sport, there appear to be fundamentally distinct ideas concerning human endeavour and the nature of competition that are worthy of critical examination. Is winning everything? Should participation or self-defining achievement be more valued? Is sport becoming too elitist? Does the obsession to win create the need for performance-enhancing drugs? Should we legalize doping or tighten control measures? Should we change the nature of professional competitive sport? Students will explore these questions through close analysis of viewpoints expressed in both scholarly literature and popular media, ultimately developing their own positions in written arguments."},{"modId":"UTW1001N","name":"Public Persona and Self-presentations","description":"Public persona is a fundamental yet unarticulated aspect of persuasion in spoken discourse. In this course, students will explore and examine speakers’ public persona with a focus on interactional and social roles in performed presentations before a public audience. What does it mean to perform a public persona? How is public persona shaped, strengthened, or attenuated? Is there such a thing as an \"authentic\" public persona?

But how similar are these vampires to the traditional vampire in Western and other cultures? In this module you will explore different explanations for the role/function of the Vampire and have the opportunity to research manifestations of the Vampire across cultures, genres and historical periods.\nYou will review different research methodologies, and compile a list of terms and ideas that enable you to participate in the conversation to understand the ongoing\nfascination with the Vampire."},{"modId":"UTW2001P","name":"Science Fiction and Empire","description":"Science fiction is less about the future than it is about the present. Many science fiction narratives critique contemporary social issues, particularly imperialism and colonialism. This course will introduce students to the theories of colonialism and their importance in a modern context. Armed with this knowledge, students will engage with classic and contemporary science fiction texts in order to understand, as well as question, how such narratives describe and proscribe ways of ordering the world. In developing their original research projects, students will explore how this intersection between popular narrative and ideology influences many of the ways we think about culture today."},{"modId":"UTW2001Q","name":"'What's in a word?' Meaning across cultures","description":"It is often assumed that there is a common understanding of what specific words mean. However, can one assume a common understanding across cultures of words describing colour, such as 'red' or 'maroon,' or emotion, such as 'happiness,' 'pleasure,' or 'disgust'? Are forms of address, such as nicknames, or interjections, such as 'damn' or the 'F' word, used in similar ways across cultures?

This module explores how meaning is culture-bound, and helps students understand cultural differences in the choice and use of words."},{"modId":"UTW2001R","name":"Discourse, Citizenship, and Society","description":"Citizens participate in society through discourse -- talk and texts. How citizens speak and write about social issues in face-to-face and online platforms therefore warrant careful reflection. This course aims to enable students to examine how individuals enact their citizenship through language and other symbols. Students will investigate how citizens mobilize language, voice, body and other resources to deal with issues pertaining to social differences, processes of exclusion, and participation in local, regional and global contexts, among others. By the end of the module, the students should be able to develop critical awareness of\nhow civic discourse shapes public issues."},{"modId":"UTW2001T","name":"Nobodiness: The Self as Story","description":"The sense of having a self pervades everyday experience as well as the stories we encounter in fiction, film, television, and video games. On the other hand, the self has been called into question from various scientific, religious, and philosophical perspectives. This module examines the concept of selfhood, considering the possibility that it may be a fabrication, and examines the positive and negative aspects of positing the existence of selfhood.

It does so by advancing various topical questions surrounding our fascination with and anxieties about the portentous and cataclysmic events leading to the end of world. Are these concerns new or culturally specific? Are these apocalyptic visions obsessed with finality or are they genuinely more interested in new beginnings? In exploring these topics, students develop skills necessary in reading primary and secondary texts, to ask focused questions and explain why they matter, and ultimately to respond with well-formed arguments."},{"modId":"UWC2101L","name":"Writing and Critical Thinking: Conditions of Happiness","description":"In this course, we will investigate a fundamental human question: what is happiness, and what do we need to attain it? Is happiness in our own control or does it depend on external circumstances, such as wealth or freedom? Are pleasure or virtue necessary or even sufficient conditions of happiness? What constitutes a meaningful life, and how is meaning related to happiness? To reflect on such questions, we will investigate the arguments of philosophers, psychologists, economists, and other thinkers over the course of three thematic units."},{"modId":"UWC2101N","name":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Clothing Identities","description":"The subject students will think, read, and write about in this module is clothing and identities. Do clothes make the man or woman? Most people accept that the clothes we wear say something about us? Particularly about our race, gender, class, and power status. But what do they say, exactly? How do they say this? Why have we learned to see clothes as speaking thus? Furthermore, if clothes say certain accepted things, what happens when people dress in inappropriate ways?"},{"modId":"UWC2101U","name":"Writing & Critical Thinking: Technologies of Home","description":"Domestic life is routinely held up for admiration as pure or natural. But how many of us experience family time/space in that way? Challenging the truism that domesticity offers a refuge from the modern world, this module recognises that technology makes it possible for modern people to be, and feel, at home. Some relevant technologies involve engines or electronics. But others organise ideas about gender, room, place and belonging. By enhancing awareness of domesticity’s “constructed nature,” this module deepens understanding of home sweet home."},{"modId":"UWC2101Y","name":"Writing and Critical Thinking: Issues in and Around Justice","description":"This module teaches writing and critical thinking by introducing students to the assumptions that inform, and the arguments for, different concepts and practices of justice.
